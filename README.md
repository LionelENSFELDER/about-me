# About "about-me"

My personal website made with Vue.js. For now it is an experiment of very simple and minimal portfolio to get hired. The essential before all.

## Phylosophy

I try to keep this project simple and minimal as possible with no d√©pendencies :trollface: .

## I use in this project:

- HTML5 and CSS3
- Javascript
- Vue.js
- Bootstrap

## Roadmap

- [x] Make a very minimal version
- [ ] Improve design (eg. add some parallax and hover effects)
- [ ] Add Vue CLI
- [ ] Integrate node.js with auto reload
- [ ] Separate design (.vue?) from data (.json?)
- [ ] Improve Directives (eg. display link only if a link available)
