# About "about-me"

My personal website made with Vue.js. For now it is an experiment of very simple and minimal portfolio to get hired. The essential before all.

## Phylosophy

I try to keep this project simple and minimal as possible with no d√©pendencies :trollface: .

## I use in this project:

- HTML5 and CSS3 (SASS)
- Javascript
- Bootstrap (+ jQuery & Popper)
- Animate css
- Vue.js (standalone file)
- Line awesome
- Gulp (Browser sync, sass compiler,images minifier, etc)
