# About "about-me"

My personal website made with Vue.js. For now it is an experiment of very simple and minimal portfolio to get hired. The essential before all.

## Phylosophy

I try to keep this project simple and minimal as possible with no d√©pendencies :trollface: .

## I use in this project:

- HTML5 and CSS3 (SASS)
- Javascript
- Bootstrap (+ jQuery & Popper)
- Animate css
- Vue.js (standalone file)
- Line awesome
- Gulp (Browser sync, sass compiler,images minifier)

## Roadmap

- [x] Make a very minimal version
- [x] Improve design
- [-] Add Vue CLI
- [x] Integrate node.js with auto reload
- [x] Separate design (components) from data
- [-] Improve Directives (eg. display link only if a link available)
